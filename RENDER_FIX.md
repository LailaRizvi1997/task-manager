# ðŸ”§ **Fix Render Deployment**

Your deployment failed because the TypeScript files weren't compiled. Here's how to fix it:

## **Quick Fix - Update Render Settings**

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Click on your failed service**
3. **Go to Settings**
4. **Update these settings:**

### **Build Command:**
```bash
npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build
```

### **Start Command:**
```bash
npm start
```

### **Root Directory:**
```
server
```

4. **Click "Save Changes"**
5. **Redeploy by clicking "Deploy Latest Commit"**

## **Alternative: Use tsx instead of compiling**

If the above doesn't work, try this simpler approach:

### **Build Command:**
```bash
npm install && npx prisma generate
```

### **Start Command:**
```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

This runs TypeScript directly without compilation.

## **Environment Variables (Don't forget these!):**

Make sure you've added these in Render:

```
DATABASE_URL = (provided by Render PostgreSQL)
JWT_SECRET = your-secret-key-here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET = your-refresh-secret-here  
NODE_ENV = production
CLIENT_URL = https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

## **If Still Failing - Use this package.json fix:**

The issue is that tsx isn't installed as a dependency. Let me fix this by updating the production dependencies.
